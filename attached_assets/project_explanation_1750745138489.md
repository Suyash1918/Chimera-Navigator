## Project Explanation

Based on the provided file list, this project appears to be a web application with both a frontend and a backend component.

**Purpose:**

The presence of files related to schema validation (`chimera.schema.json`, `shared/schema.ts`, `client/src/lib/schema-validator.ts`), AST parsing (`client/src/lib/ast-parser.ts`), code generation (implied by the project name "Chimera" and the file `foreman.py`, which could be a code generation tool), and various UI components suggests that the project's core purpose is likely related to **defining, validating, and potentially generating code or data structures based on a defined schema.** The UI components point to a user interface for interacting with this process, potentially for schema editing (`client/src/components/schema-editor.tsx`), visualizing data (`client/src/components/ast-viewer.tsx`), and tracking progress (`client/src/components/progress-tracker.tsx`).

**Technologies Used:**

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React/TypeScript:** Indicated by `.tsx` files (`client/src/App.tsx`, `client/src/main.tsx`, and numerous component files in `client/src/components/`).
    *   **Vite:** Used as the build tool (`client/vite.ts`, `vite.config.ts`).
    *   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework (`tailwind.config.ts`, `client/src/index.css`).
    *   **Shadcn/ui:** A collection of reusable components built with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI (indicated by the large number of files in `client/src/components/ui/`).
    *   **react-query:** For data fetching and caching (`client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`).
    *   **Firebase:** For authentication (`client/src/lib/firebase.ts`, `client/src/components/auth-provider.tsx`, `client/src/components/auth-header.tsx`).
*   **Backend:**
    *   **TypeScript/Node.js:** Indicated by `.ts` files in the `server` directory (`server/index.ts`, `server/routes.ts`, `server/db.ts`, `server/storage.ts`).
    *   **Express.js (likely):** A popular Node.js web application framework (implied by `server/routes.ts`).
    *   **Drizzle ORM:** A type-safe ORM for TypeScript (`drizzle.config.ts`, `server/db.ts`).
    *   **Python:** Used for potential backend processing or tooling (`foreman.py`, `pipeline.py`, `surveyor.py`).

**Components:**

The project is structured into several key components:

*   **Frontend (`client/`):** This contains the user interface, built with React and TypeScript. It includes various UI components for user interaction, data display, and schema management. Key components include:
    *   Core application logic (`client/src/App.tsx`, `client/src/main.tsx`).
    *   UI components from Shadcn/ui (`client/src/components/ui/`).
    *   Custom components for specific functionalities like AST viewing, schema editing, file uploads, and progress tracking (`client/src/components/`).
    *   Utility functions and hooks (`client/src/lib/`, `client/src/hooks/`).
    *   Pages for different views (`client/src/pages/`).
*   **Backend (`server/`):** This handles server-side logic, API routes, database interactions, and potentially storage. Key components include:
    *   Server entry point (`server/index.ts`).
    *   Route definitions (`server/routes.ts`).
    *   Database interactions using Drizzle ORM (`server/db.ts`).
    *   File storage handling (`server/storage.ts`).
*   **Shared (`shared/`):** This directory likely contains code or definitions used by both the frontend and the backend, such as the shared schema definition (`shared/schema.ts`).
*   **Tooling/Utilities:** Python scripts like `foreman.py`, `pipeline.py`, and `surveyor.py` suggest backend processing, code generation, or data analysis capabilities.
*   **Configuration Files:** Various configuration files (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.js`, `drizzle.config.ts`, `vite.config.ts`) manage dependencies, build processes, and project settings.
*   **Schema Definitions:** The core schema definition in JSON and TypeScript formats (`chimera.schema.json`, `shared/schema.ts`).
*   **Assets:** Stored assets, potentially related to the project description or examples (`attached_assets/`).
